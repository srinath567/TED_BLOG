Tech Blog
This project involved the development of a fully
functional blog website using the Django framework.
The website allows users to create, edit, and delete
blog posts, as well as Register and login page. The
homepage displays a list of recent posts and users
can navigate to individual post pages for more
detailed information. User authentication and
registration functionality was also implemented. The
website was developed using a combination of
Django for the back-end and HTML and CSS for the
front-end.
